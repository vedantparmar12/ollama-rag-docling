# âœ… Database Path Fixed!

## What was the issue?
The backend server was looking for `backend/chat_data.db` while running FROM the backend directory, which caused a path error.

## What was fixed?
Updated `backend/database.py` to automatically detect if it's running from:
- Project root â†’ uses `backend/chat_data.db`
- Backend directory â†’ uses `chat_data.db`

## How to restart the services:

### Step 1: Stop all services
```bash
stop.bat
```

### Step 2: Start again
```bash
start_all.bat
```

## Expected Result:
All 3 services should start without errors:
- âœ… RAG API Server (port 8001)
- âœ… Backend Server (port 8000) - **NOW FIXED**
- âœ… Frontend Server (port 3000)

## Verify it's working:
```bash
status.bat
```

All services should show âœ… RUNNING

**The database path issue is now resolved!** ðŸŽ‰
